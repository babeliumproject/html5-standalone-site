List of steps that we followed:
   # Identify layout file hierarchy 
   # Migrate styles from FLEX to CSS3 syntax
   # Migrate basic components from MXML to HTML5 + CSS3
   # Migrate custom components from MXML to HTML5 + CSS3 + JS (JQuery)

The following list shows files which contains babelium's layout.

{{{
Main.mxml								* Root file
|--- Main.css							* Style
|--- modules/main/Header.mxml			* Header: top bar
|--- modules/main/Navigation.mxml		* Navigation links + search bar
|--- modules/main/Body.mxml				* Modules container
|--- modules/main/Footer.mxml			* Footer: copyright, about us..

= Styles from FLEX to CSS3 =

In babelium we had an unique style file called *Main.css*. Using our custom script we ported that style file to a new CSS3 one.
